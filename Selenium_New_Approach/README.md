# New Approach is better than previous use of Selenium. 

Instructions:
* Install Selenium Intellij Plugin if not done yet. 
* Using File->New->Project create new Selenium project specifying required parameters and libraries.
* Add to pom.xml "webdrivermanager" dependency. It is required only to install this dependency without specifying "chrome driver system property". 
* Write your test.
